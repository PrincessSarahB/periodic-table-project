## Brief

Educational App
The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus
MVP
Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content
Some samples of existing apps for inspiration:

http://histography.io - may only work in Safari
